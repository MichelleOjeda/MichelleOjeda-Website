        <p class="lead mb-4">I am a sophmore currently pursuing a career in psychology at the University of California, Riverside. It is a field I feel like I can enjoy since I am helping others who I can relate to. It is a way to feel others feel like they are understood depending on certain circumstances. I was always one to provide assistance whether it be from family or close friends and it is possibly the reason why I chose this field. It was an interest of how people are the same, but can be drastically affected by a certain environment or a problem within themselves. It is cruel how these type of situations can simply affect the rest of one's life so negatively when compared to a certain population.<br><br>

        The idea of choosing a type of career in this field comes from noticing my constant observations of others. It is interesting how certain situations can impact an individuals state of mind and actions. Due to the fact that I am working in customer oriented environments, I feel comfortable talking to others and assisting people with their concerns. With some of th work I have already done, I feel as is this an appropriate field since I have developed certain skills since I deal with one on one engagements on the daily. I have learned through constant pressure that patience and understanding is key to be able to work and feel comfortable around others. Through the hardships, whether they are related to school or work, I feel I have some skills would help be able to assist me with the kind of work I want to do.<br><br>

        I am currently undecided on what specific field I am leaning towards, but at this time I am narrowing it down to either a child psychologist or forensic psychologist. These branches caught my interest as they concern those who were affected early and those who suffered the consequenes. I understand that these fields could impact me as well, but I am willing to help those involved in the situations since they are ones in need. I always wanted to do something with art, but decided against it as I have been told that it was a field that did not provide much. I never pushed myself to try things more abstract since I felt using lead and charcoal made the drawing seem more direct. I never used color even if it was idealized because it most cases it didnt seem real. For me it was difficult to create something that could not easily be erased so I was stayed within my comfort zone because I did not to ruin anything. If possible, I want to bring my interests into my work so I do not feel any regrets, but in a way that could possibly help others as well. The ability to bring somebody out of a monotone world could possibly fill in the space I was scared to do all along and probably let me enjoy the path I am currently taking.
